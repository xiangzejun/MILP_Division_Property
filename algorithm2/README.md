### Algorithm 2

- This folder contains the Python code to calculate the division trails of a given sbox, and the division trails will be stored in cipher_DivisionTrails.txt.

- This code takes the PRESENT Sbox as an example and calculates its division trails. You can replace the sbox specification in main.py with any other Sbox to calculate its division trails.
